# Clashtools Backend Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of improvement tasks for the Clashtools Backend project. Each task is designed to enhance the application's security, performance, code quality, or feature set.

## Security Improvements

1. [ ] Store JWT secret key in environment variables or a secure vault instead of generating it at runtime
2. [ ] Implement proper CORS configuration with specific allowed origins instead of wildcard "*"
3. [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
4. [ ] Implement account lockout mechanism after multiple failed login attempts
5. [ ] Add password complexity requirements during registration
6. [ ] Implement email verification process for new user registrations
7. [ ] Use generic error messages for authentication failures to prevent username enumeration
8. [ ] Add CSRF protection for non-GET endpoints that modify state
9. [ ] Implement secure password reset functionality
10. [ ] Add token revocation mechanism for compromised JWT tokens
11. [ ] Implement refresh token rotation (issue new refresh token when current one is used)
12. [ ] Restrict Swagger UI access to specific roles or environments
13. [ ] Add security headers (Content-Security-Policy, X-XSS-Protection, etc.)

## Performance Improvements

14. [ ] Configure database connection pooling for optimal performance
15. [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed, rarely changed data
16. [ ] Optimize database queries and add appropriate indexes
17. [ ] Implement pagination for endpoints that return large collections
18. [ ] Configure appropriate JVM memory settings for production
19. [ ] Disable excessive SQL logging in production environment
20. [ ] Add database query performance monitoring
21. [ ] Implement asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

## Code Quality Improvements

22. [x] Remove commented-out code throughout the codebase
23. [x] Add comprehensive JavaDoc documentation for all public methods

26. [x] Create separate DTOs for request and response objects
27. [x] Refactor controllers to follow consistent patterns
28. [x] Extract hardcoded values into constants or configuration properties
29. [x] Implement proper validation for all input data
30. [x] Add null checks and defensive programming techniques
31. [x] Use constructor injection consistently instead of field injection

## Testing Improvements

32. [x] Implement unit tests for all service classes
33. [ ] Add integration tests for REST endpoints
34. [ ] Create database repository tests
35. [x] Implement security tests for authentication and authorization
36. [x] Add performance/load tests for critical endpoints
37. [ ] Set up test coverage reporting and maintain high coverage
38. [ ] Implement contract tests for API endpoints
39. [ ] Create test data factories for consistent test data

## DevOps and Infrastructure

40. [ ] Set up environment-specific configuration (dev, test, prod)
41. [ ] Configure Hibernate to use update or validate in production instead of create
42. [ ] Move database credentials to environment variables or secrets management
43. [ ] Implement database migration tool (Flyway or Liquibase)
44. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
45. [ ] Configure health check endpoints and monitoring
46. [ ] Implement proper logging infrastructure with centralized log collection
47. [ ] Set up Docker containerization for consistent deployment
48. [ ] Configure backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Feature Enhancements

49. [ ] Implement user profile management functionality
50. [ ] Add role-based access control for fine-grained permissions
51. [ ] Implement audit logging for security-sensitive operations
52. [ ] Add support for OAuth2/OpenID Connect for third-party authentication
53. [ ] Implement API versioning strategy
54. [ ] Add multi-language support
